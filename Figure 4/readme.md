### Figure 4

-   To generate Figure 4, execute the script Figure4.m. Before executing the script add [Distinguish Colors](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29702-generate-maximally-perceptually-distinct-colors and [SAFE Toolbox](https://safetoolbox.github.io/) to the MATLAB path. 
-   Please note that the code can be computationally intensive, and simulations might yield slightly different results.
-   To mitigate this, we have saved the workspace of the simulations. Alternatively, you can use EET_workspace.mat to generate the figure.
