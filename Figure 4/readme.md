### Figure 4

-   To generate Figure 4, execute the script Figure4.m.
-   Please note that the code can be computationally intensive, and simulations might yield slightly different results.
-   To mitigate this, we have saved the workspace of the simulations. Alternatively, you can use EET_workspace.mat to generate the figure.
